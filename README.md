# Blackjack game
 
Overview//
Welcome to the Blackjack Game Simulation repository! This project is a text-based Blackjack game built in C++. It's designed to demonstrate mastery in object-oriented programming (OOP) and highlight the capabilities of C++ in creating interactive and engaging simulations. The game replicates the classic Blackjack experience, offering both entertainment and a showcase of modern software engineering principles.

Features//

Object-Oriented Design: Fully embraces OOP principles, encapsulating game logic, player actions, and card management in distinct classes.

Dynamic Deck Shuffling: Features a shuffling mechanism for the deck, ensuring a unique and unpredictable gaming experience in each session.

Error Handling and Validation: Implements checks and error handling to ensure robust user inputs and game integrity.

Score Calculation System: Accurately calculates and updates the scores following Blackjack rules, including special cases like Aces being 1 or 11.

Interactive User Interface: Provides a clear, console-based interface for gameplay, making it accessible and easy to navigate.

Components//

Game Flow Management: Controls the progression of the game from betting to conclusion, including decisions like hit, stand, and double down.

Player and Dealer Actions: Manages the actions of both the player and the dealer, reflecting real-life Blackjack scenarios.

Betting System: Allows players to place bets, with dynamic tracking of player's balance through wins, losses, and draws.

Automatic Dealer Logic: Automates dealer decisions based on standard Blackjack rules, enhancing the realism of the game.

Technologies Used//

C++: Used for its efficiency and suitability for complex logical implementations in games.

STL (Standard Template Library): Utilized for managing collections of cards and handling game dynamics.

Random Number Generation: Ensures fair and unpredictable shuffling of the deck for each game.
